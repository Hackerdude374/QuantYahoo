Quant Finance: Key Terms Explained
==================================

1. Ticker Symbol
----------------
A ticker symbol is a unique series of letters assigned to a security or stock for trading purposes.
Examples:
- MSFT: Microsoft Corporation
- AAPL: Apple Inc.
- TSLA: Tesla Inc.

Tickers are used in code and charts to pull specific stock data.

2. OHLCV Data
-------------
OHLCV stands for Open, High, Low, Close, Volume â€” the five key metrics for any trading period.

- Open:
  The price of the first trade for the time period (e.g., day, hour, or minute).

- High:
  The highest price the stock reached during the time period.

- Low:
  The lowest price the stock reached during the time period.

- Close:
  The price of the last trade for the time period. Used most commonly in chart analysis.

- Volume:
  The total number of shares traded during the time period. High volume often indicates higher interest or volatility.

Example (for MSFT on a single day):
| Date       | Open  | High  | Low   | Close | Volume   |
|------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 2025-06-20 | 330.0 | 335.5 | 328.2 | 332.0 | 1,540,000|

3. Time Intervals
------------------
Stock data can be recorded over different intervals depending on the use case:
- "1d" : Daily data (used for swing/long-term trading)
- "5m": 5-minute data (used for intraday/short-term analysis)
- "1h": Hourly data

4. Adjusted Close
------------------
Adjusted Close is the closing price adjusted for corporate actions like dividends, splits, and rights offerings.
It reflects the "true" value to shareholders and is usually used in backtesting strategies.

Summary Table:
--------------
| Term     | Description                                |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Ticker   | Code representing a company (e.g., MSFT)   |
| Open     | Price at the start of the interval         |
| High     | Maximum price during the interval          |
| Low      | Minimum price during the interval          |
| Close    | Price at the end of the interval           |
| Volume   | Shares traded during the interval          |
| Adj Close| Close price adjusted for dividends/splits  |

These terms are the foundation of quantitative analysis in finance. Understanding them is crucial before diving into indicators, backtesting, or algorithmic trading.
