Download and organize multi-stock OHLCV and Adjusted Close data using yfinance

This script uses the Yahoo Finance API to:
1. Collect adjusted closing prices for multiple tickers in a single DataFrame.
2. Collect full OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Adj Close) in a dictionary.
3. Demonstrate best practices like modular data handling, structured storage, and datetime usage.
